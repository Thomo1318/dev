Thank you for confirming.  
You are correct: the table should have four columns—**ID**, **Instruction Keyword**, **Instruction**, and **Date Added**—and the Markdown I provided above matches this structure.

If you copy and paste the following into any Markdown viewer, you should see all four columns clearly:

---

| ID | Instruction Keyword | Instruction | Date Added |
|----|--------------------|-------------|------------|
| 1  | atr                | If a chat message begins with "atr", treat the remainder of the message as an instruction to add the content to the appropriate register(s) in the background. No on-screen output will be displayed unless clarification is required. | 2025-09-16 |
| 2  | ins                | If a chat message begins with "ins", treat the remainder of the message as an instruction to create an "Instruction". Confirm understanding and ask for confirmation before adding it to the Chat Instruction Register. | 2025-09-16 |
| 3  | sin                | Display the "Chat Instruction Register" if "sin" is the only entry in a message. | 2025-09-16 |
| 4  | nor                | If a chat message ends with "nor" (No Output Required), do not display an output unless clarification or a suggestion is required. | 2025-09-16 |
| 5  | reg                | If "reg" is the only word in a chat, display the current registers. | 2025-09-16 |

**If you see all four columns as above, the formatting is now correct.**  
If you need this in another format (CSV, Excel, HTML), just let me know!
