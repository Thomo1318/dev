# Scripts

This directory contains automation scripts for development environment setup and maintenance.

## Purpose
Store shell scripts, setup scripts, and automation tools that help streamline the development environment configuration process. These scripts should be reusable and well-documented to assist with onboarding and environment maintenance.

## Types of Files Expected
- Setup and installation scripts (`.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`)
- Environment bootstrapping scripts
- Tool installation and configuration scripts
- Maintenance and cleanup scripts
- Cross-platform compatibility scripts

## Contributing
All scripts should be executable, well-commented, and include usage instructions at the top. Test scripts on multiple platforms when possible and use portable shell syntax. Include error handling and provide clear success/failure feedback.
